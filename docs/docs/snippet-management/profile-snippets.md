# Working with profile snippets

SnippetStudio has great support for [VS Code profiles](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/profiles). When adding a global snippet, it will add it to the active profile.

## Multi profile Snippets

You can right click a snippet file and choose to link <i className="codicon codicon-link"></i> it across multiple profiles.

1. Create snippets file
2. Right click to "choose profiles to use this snippet"
3. The snippet file will be moved/copied to the other profiles
