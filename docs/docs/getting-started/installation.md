# Installation

Let's *extend* VS Code's functionality by installing an extension!

## Getting Started

1. Install SnippetStudio in the [VS Code Extension Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AlexDombroski.snippetstudio) or [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/AlexDombroski/snippetstudio)
2. Click on the Snippet Studio Manager <i className="codicon codicon-repo"></i> in the VS Code Activity Bar

### What you'll need

A desktop version of VS Code or a fork of it. The extension isn't yet stable for web versions of VS Code <i className="codicon codicon-vscode"></i>

- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [VS Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/)
- [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/)
- [Cursor](https://cursor.com/)
- [Windsurf](https://windsurf.com/)
- [Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/)
- [Trae](https://www.trae.ai/)
- [AbacusAI](https://desktop.abacus.ai/)

### Alternative Installation Method

Do you prefer installing extensions the *extra hard* way?

If the Microsft's Extension Marketplace is down for some reason, you can [install via a VSIX file](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/extensions/extension-marketplace#_install-from-a-vsix) from [SnippetStudio releases](https://github.com/alexanderdombroski/snippetstudio/releases).
