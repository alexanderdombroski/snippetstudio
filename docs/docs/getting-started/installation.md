# Installation

Let's *extend* VS Code's functionality by installing an extension!

## Getting Started

1. Install SnippetStudio in the [VS Code Extension Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AlexDombroski.snippetstudio)
2. Click on the Snippet Studio Manager <i className="codicon codicon-repo"></i> in the VS Code Activity Bar

### What you'll need

- A desktop version of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). The extension isn't yet stable for web versions of VS Code <i className="codicon codicon-vscode"></i>

### Alternative Installation Method

Do you prefer installing extensions the *extra hard* way?

If the Microsft's Extension Marketplace is down for some reason, you can [install via a VSIX file](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/extensions/extension-marketplace#_install-from-a-vsix) from [SnippetStudio releases](https://github.com/alexanderdombroski/snippetstudio/releases).
