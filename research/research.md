# Research

I have big plans for snippetstudio

## Discussions requiring research

Topics that DEFINITLY require research

- [Web Support](https://github.com/alexanderdombroski/snippetstudio/discussions/21)
- [Shell Snippets](https://github.com/alexanderdombroski/snippetstudio/discussions/20)
- [Import/Export snippets from other IDEs](https://github.com/alexanderdombroski/snippetstudio/discussions/23)

Add files to folders within this folder to help plan, size, and gain proof of concept for these future features
