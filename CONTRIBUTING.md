# Contributing to SnippetStudio

Thanks for taking the time to contribute! Please follow these steps and guidelines.

## Issues

## Contributing to extension

- For new features, submit a [feature request](https://github.com/alexanderdombroski/snippetstudio/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml)

### Testing the Extension

VS Code makes it easy to test extensions. You can [run the extension using the debugger](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/debugging#_start-a-debugging-session). This will only work if the project is opened as the root of the workspace. ie (`.vscode/launch.json` is at the root of the filetree).

If you're testing for another IDE, you can package the extension as a vsix and install it.

1. npm run package
2. npx vsce package

### Steps to Contribute

5. Push your branch and open your fork on github
6. Open a Pull Request (press the `contribute` then `open pull request` buttons)
