## Contributing to extension

- For new features, submit a [feature request](https://github.com/alexanderdombroski/snippetstudio/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml)

### Testing the Extension

VS Code makes it easy to test extensions. You can [run the extension using the debugger](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/debugtest/debugging#_start-a-debugging-session). This will only fully work if the project is opened as the root of the workspace and you've installed the extensions listed in `.vscode/extensions.json`.

If you're testing for another IDE, you can package the extension as a vsix and install it.

1. npm run package
2. npx vsce package

### Steps to Contribute

3. Use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

5. Push your branch and open your fork on github
6. Open a Pull Request (press the `contribute` then `open pull request` buttons)
