# Edit an existing Snippet

Let's now edit an existing snippet in the **Snippets** view.

1. Hover over a snippet and click the pencil.
2. Change the snippet code, description or prefix.
3. If you change the snippet title, the changes will create a new snippet, rather than overwriting the old one.
4. Click `Save` or the checkmark to finish.

Now you know the basics of how to manage snippets!
