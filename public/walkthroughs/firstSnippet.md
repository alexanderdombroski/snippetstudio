# Create a Global Snippet

## Start the Editor

1.  Highlight the code you want to use for your snippet, or don't select anything to start fresh.
3. In the snippets view, hit the `+` on the snippet file you would like to save the snippet to, or the `+` next to the *snippets* view title to add it globally.

## Create the Snippet

1. Edit the snippet body in the editor, then find the snippet editor view in the sidebar.
2. Add a prefix - This is what you type to autocomplete a snippet into your code and the main title that appears in the suggestion box.
3. Add a unique Title - This appears as a description to the right of the title, and it must be unique for every snippet in the file.
4. Add an *optional* Description - This shows when hovering over the selection of the suggestion box.
5. Hit `Save` under the form, or the checkmark at the top of the snippet code editor.

You've now created your first snippet! Is it perfect? Try editing it.
